# iServer
## What is it?  
iServer is a MCPE server sfotware written in PHP.
## Can i make plugins for it?  
Of course! This extends the PocketMine library and runs the same protocols. As long as you plugin works there, it should work here.
## Is there is a plugin respository?
YES!! It is called (PocketBukkit)[https://pocketbukkit.weebly.com]
## Does this README go on forever?
Sadly... No. It ends here my good friend. Hope this works out!
